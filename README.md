# ðŸ”¹ MACH EXPLORER DESKTOP APPLICATION ðŸ”¹

The Mach Explorer is a desktop application developed in tandem with the MACH dataset (Sink et al, 2025). This app allows users to navigate
and manipulate the MACH dataset, which contains daily climate and streamflow data (1980-2023) and catchment attributes for 1,014 watersheds, along with 
daily climate and streamflow data (1949-1979) for 395 watersheds within the United States.  

<br>

## ðŸ”¹DATASET IMPORT TAB
Enables the application to access timeseries data located on a user's local machine. The folder location(s) are necessary for the data tabs. Only time series data needs to be downloaded. All other data is included with the app with 
the exception of the detailed dam information, which can be found on zenodo. 

### Data Import
**The Daily Data, Monthly Data, and Annual Data tabs use data from the MACH timeseries.** 
* Prior to utilizing any of these tabs, download the  *MACH_ts.zip*  folder from https://zenodo.org/records/15311986.
* Unzip the folder to your local machine, making sure to retain the 'MACH_ts' folder name and the 1,014 csv files within.

**The MOPEX tab uses data from the MOPEX timeseries.**
* Prior to utilizing this tab, download the *MOPEX_ts.zip* folder from https://zenodo.org/records/15311986.
* Unzip the folder to your local machine, making sure to retain the 'MOPEX_ts' folder name and the 395 csv files within.

### Locate Files
